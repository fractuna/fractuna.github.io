  <p><b>Who I am?</b></p>
  <p>Hello, my name is Ashkan and my internet/work name is fractuna. I found myself obsessed with computer science.
    Recently I started working on games and game development, and I love it. sometimes I play games and read books. I
    like minimalism and orgenizing stuff, it makes my brain clean and fresh.</p>

  <b>What I do most of the times?</b>
  <p>I do work on projects that I found interesting, I do programming and modding games and sometimes I just write
    stupid amount of scripts to automate what I usually do manually.</p>

  <b>OS?</b>
  <p>Whenever I found that I can use linux, I will. I use it because it's simple, easy and powerfull. most of the times
    I use Fedora, but I do some distro hopping sometimes. You can find my
    dotfiles at my <a href="#3">git</a></p> (Not available for now)

  <b>What are the tools that I use?</b>
  <p>(Most of the times I use whatever I have), but my usual environment is: fedora linux, neovim, kitty</p>
