That’s a great project to work on for learning Rust and cryptography! Let’s discuss your file-based storage design and potential improvements.\n💾 File vs. Database Storage\nRegarding your question about using individual files (folder + files) versus a database:\nThe approach of using AES-encrypted files for your data is a good and common approach for a minimal, local password manager (like the Unix pass or KeePass).\n✅ Advantages of Encrypted Files:\nSimplicity and Minimal Dependencies: You avoid adding a database engine (like SQLite) dependency, making your project lighter and easier to manage. This aligns well with your goal of making it minimal.\n\nSecurity (with proper encryption): Since all the files are encrypted with AES, they are just as secure as an encrypted database file—provided your master key derivation (using a KDF like Argon2) is strong and your AES implementation (e.g., using AES-256-GCM) is sound.\n\nEasy Backup/Sync: The user only needs to back up/sync the entire directory of encrypted files.\n\n⚠️ Disadvantage of Encrypted Files:\nMetadata Leakage: This is the biggest security concern with a file-per-entry system. Even though the contents of your password files are encrypted, the filenames, directory names, file sizes, and timestamps are often visible to an attacker who compromises the file system but not your encryption key.\n\n    Example: If you name your files after the service (e.g., github.pass, bank.pass), an attacker instantly knows the list of all services you have accounts for.\n\nPerformance: For a large number of entries, iterating over hundreds or thousands of files in a directory can be slower than querying a single database file.\n\n💡 Recommendation: Use a Single Encrypted Vault File\nTo maintain simplicity but solve the metadata leakage problem, the most popular approach for local managers is to use a single, encrypted file (a “vault”) that contains all your password entries and metadata (like the KeePass .kdbx format).\nThis way, an attacker only sees one file with a generic name (e.g., vault.bin or psm.dat), and all metadata (service names, usernames, etc.) are hidden within the file’s encrypted contents.\n🚀 Suggested Project Improvements\nHere are some improvements and best practices to consider for your Rust password manager:\n\n\n🛡️ Cryptographic Best Practices\nKey Derivation Function (KDF): Ensure you are using a modern, memory-hard, and time-costly KDF like Argon2 (specifically Argon2id) to derive the strong encryption key from the user’s master password. Hashing the master password directly (like with SHA-256) is not secure enough.\n Check: Are you using a KDF with an appropriate salt, iterations/time cost, memory cost, and parallelism settings?\n\nAuthenticated Encryption: Ensure you are using an authenticated encryption mode for AES, like AES-256-GCM. This not only encrypts the data but also provides an integrity check (a MAC) to ensure the encrypted data hasn’t been tampered with. It looks like you’re using aes_gcm, which is great!\n\n\n📝 Secret Handling in Memory\nMemory Zeroing: Sensitive data, like the master password or decrypted passwords, should be zeroed out (overwritten with zeroes) from memory as soon as they are no longer needed. This prevents them from being unintentionally leaked by memory inspection or saved to disk in hibernation/swap files.\n Rust Crates: Look into crates like zeroize or secrecy that provide wrapper types (like Secret&lt;T&gt;) to handle memory zeroing automatically upon drop.\n\nCommand Line Argument Security: Never accept the master password as a direct command-line argument (e.g., psm login —password “my_pass”). Command-line arguments can be read by other users on the system (via ps aux or Task Manager) and are often saved in shell history files.\n Solution: Use interactive prompt for the master password (e.g., using a crate like rpassword to read the input securely without echoing) or read it from standard input (stdin).\n\n\n\n✨ Usability and Features\nPassword Generation: A password manager is incomplete without a built-in strong, random password generator. This is a high-value feature for security and convenience.\nClipboard Management: Implement logic to copy the decrypted password to the clipboard and then automatically clear the clipboard after a short timeout (e.g., 30-60 seconds). This mitigates the risk of the password being left in the clipboard buffer.\n\n\nI hope this helps you move forward with your awesome project!\nWould you like me to look into a specific section of your code (e.g., how you handle the master password or the encryption) to provide more targeted feedback?\nBy the way, to unlock the full functionality of all Apps, enable Gemini Apps Activity."},"01---Projects/psm/psm":{"slug":"01---Projects/psm/psm","filePath":"01 - Projects/psm/psm.md","title":"psm","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Current Progress\nChange-logs\nIdeas\n\nuse a ‘vault’ like file instead of saving all password inside a folder, because we could have metadata leaking system.\nuse interactive command line approach instead of per-line things, because the shell often save the commands and this can be bad.\nbuild-in password generation\nturn passwords into structures and then make them bincode binary to encode them to AES and then save them.\nuse ‘crab’ for argument reading system2\n\nBug Fixes\n\nProject will have a re-write\n"},"01---Projects/retrocloud/Retrocloud":{"slug":"01---Projects/retrocloud/Retrocloud","filePath":"01 - Projects/retrocloud/Retrocloud.md","title":"Retrocloud","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Well… It’s an amazing project :&gt;"},"02---Blogs/General/Slow-communication-concept":{"slug":"02---Blogs/General/Slow-communication-concept","filePath":"02 - Blogs/General/Slow communication concept.md","title":"Slow communication concept","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Greetings internet folks, and here we are… the blog that I’ve always wanted to write and talk about. In this blog we are going to talk about my prefer way of communication in the modern days of technology and real-time social applications. But before that let me introduce you with the concept of Slow Media.\nIf you search about Slow Media you can get some good contents about it, but today I want to talk about my own experiences and how they effect my life and how I treat them now. It’s very easy to just talk about how modern technologies want our attention and time to gain money and power, and that’s the point that should make us more aware, we should care about our life and personal feelings, but we don’t because they are using something like Magic to gain our attention without us even realizing it. you may ask what is that magic thing? well it’s not easy and short to explain but in the simple term, those magical stuff are actual facts about the way our brain work. Human brain is not perfect as we all know, and if we don’t really try to structure it in a good way we end up becoming zombies that follow others movements. a great example of that is the modern model of so called Doom Scrolling. Doom scrolling design model tends to keep users online and active without them realizing how much time they are spending on the platform, I don’t really talk about it much more cause unfortunately we all understand how life consuming it is (and we still do it).\nThe combination of a good social media in today’s world is not just Good Technical engineering, it has multiple other non-technical factors and one of those complex concepts is users attention. Connecting people together is a simple idea that we had since the beginning of the internet but in modern days we are overflowing it with new ideas and hypes that on paper is great but in reality it makes us more isolated and reclusive. All of these things exist while connecting people together is a simple concept that we already have as human kind and we don’t have any problem with it, and extending this structure makes it complex enough for us to ignore it.\nOne important part of modern days of technology is Speed, it is all about how fast you can reach information at any time, as you can see all modern applications are doing this model of infinity scrolling or doom scrolling cause it is optimized to give us more information in a small amount of time. Tiktok is a good example of a platform that changes the behavior of users perfectly, now a days people buy books to not read them and put them in an organized manner cause it looks good. refer → [video]\nA great example of this is reading Books, we don’t read books because it feels boring and slow (notice on the word slow, we are going to return for this one), but the reality itself is not working like that, any valuable knowledge need hard work and hard work needs time. by reading a document you learn more than what you want and that’s actually good!. That’s good to learn more and have something to learn for the future. reading is the base of being more patient and slow, now that I talked"},"02---Blogs/web/Let's-have-a-talk...":{"slug":"02---Blogs/web/Let's-have-a-talk...","filePath":"02 - Blogs/web/Let's have a talk....md","title":"Let's have a talk...","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Hello and Hello after a while! I’m here again and writing blogs to talk about my inner thoughts Xd.\nWell let’s be honest everything changed and I think I’m growing like a real person (at least I hope so)\nI made a blog post about my tend to make games, well… it didn’t go well in some senses. First of all, I really like the game development and I believe I need more learning curves for it xd. But the thing is… right now I can’t make any effort from it. I really like the programming side of it and this is not actually enough for someone who is not great at art, I know learning &amp; trying can make the best of the best, but it’s not for me right now. But the thing is… I still make games in my free times, and I still love the process as I always do.\nBut you may ask, Ok eiko… but what do you do now? well it’s a great question, I returned to back-end development xd, Yea you hear it right, I’m going to start the process from zero (I did started btw) and try to fill the gaps that I had and call myself a back-end developer. It’s patient and some logical reasons in the same time. patient because I like it obviously and logical reasons are things like financial situation and some other things. Yes that gd financial situation!. I don’t know you noticed this before, making games is not great for someone who needs money (Specially if you didn’t used to it) and wants to actually do something that has financial future. It’s great that some games sell for millions and dollars but the thing is… it’s not a promise job, and you may not gain anything at all!\nBut again, I will do it as hobby and maybe someday I made something cool and exciting :).\nOh well, let’s more talk about the concepts instead of my situation. I started back-end developing as a hobby because I wanted to make my website more interactive to others. I did some PHP and I switched to Flask, A simple minimal (Maybe it’s feature rich right now, idk) python library to work with web servers. It was find for me and I liked to do anything by my own. That was not a problem for that old version of me, because I was literally 14 or 15 years old, and imagine how much you could do without the how much fun you could have with a minimal architecture library that lets you do anything by your own. but that same reason, made me a very strict person in the sense of learning things. I used to be a programming that wants to do anything without using libraries and ready-to-go frameworks. that’s why I have never learned Django, Another python framework for back-end stuff. after some years (now i’m 21) I can feel this pressure that the right option is to learn by standard and try to understand that there is some code that is more well structures than mind and sometime I need to calm down and let others do magical stuff for me. yea… it has been very hard for me to change, but I’m trying. All of the things that i said was the bridge to learn more love level stuff and trying to do anything by my own. that’s why I started learning C/C++ after python and step inside the real stuff. I learned C, Make, C++, low level compiler concepts like compiler, linking, dynamic libraries, etc. and I forgot that I need to continue learn the thing that I started, back-end development\nI always liked the concept of back-end development. It feels like you are writing real software (i’m sorry front-end guys, I’m not just not good at speaking Xd) and you can so cool stuff. Same stuff that you do on your system-base programs and just turn them into a web application. Literally just work with I/O data that comes and goes as HTTP requests. you have an interface that works with HTTP (or maybe you are supporting more network protocols) and you have your main code that works by anything (F.g creating online game logic). that is a great thing cause now you write software and you connect it to some sort of network stack that can open new gates of ideas for you. That’s why I love back-end development and it feels good to do it.\nI did some projects related to web development and learned one of the biggest things in my life, Golang. It’s very funny cause I learned it just because I wanted to learn something new and volla, it just made me a different person. But you may guess why I like it since I explained that I’m a person who likes minimalism. after learning golang I decided to do more projects (I’m talking about 1 year ago) and I did some. But the thing is I still didn’t learned it the way I should. I just learn interested things of it and made some projects, but this is not enough for someone to be a real Software engineer. Now, in these days I decided to start over and grow from basic stuff to professional concepts and fill that gap for myself. For sure I can learn more quickly as I have some background in this profession. I have been struggling with some thoughts like maybe i’m late. But the reality is you start from a point and get better at that point, it doesn’t matter when you start, it matter how you keep going and how much patient you are. If you don’t start now you will say: I wish I started before and this is though alone can make more nested thoughts like maybe i’m late. No, you are not late. you just need to start right now and prevent yourself saying that thing again in the future. Well i can say it is working for me now. I feel better and I feel like I a goal in my life.\nWell Hope you’ll have a great time, and like always, Happy Coding"},"02---Blogs/web/Why-IndieWeb":{"slug":"02---Blogs/web/Why-IndieWeb","filePath":"02 - Blogs/web/Why IndieWeb?.md","title":"Why IndieWeb?","links":[],"tags":["indieweb"],"content":"Greetings, have you ever ask yourself what is the purpose of creating handmade websites as a non-technical person using coding language likes HTML/CSS or even Javascript? well if it is then seems like you know what indie web is, but if you don’t know what exactly is that term, well I’ll got you.\nWe use Indie web as a term for people who make personal (sometimes even non-personal) websites with their own creativity and host those websites by themselves. but for sure there is multiple free hosting platforms that do this automaticly like Neocities, Nekoweb, etc.\nThis"},"02---Blogs/web/my-new-noting-website":{"slug":"02---Blogs/web/my-new-noting-website","filePath":"02 - Blogs/web/my new noting website.md","title":"my new noting website","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Well hello there! and greetings to this corner of the indie web. Today I want to showcase one of the things that I learned (still learning) and maybe it will inspire you for your next works. As always I was taking notes of my works and writing some day diary for myself that I got an idea, what if I could turn my development website that was nothing but just a direct link to my Github page into my technical notes, then all the technical and even non-technical users can read it and I can make a closer communication to my users.\nAs someone who doesn’t have much friends and social interactions, I have to find a way to interact with people and one way that I found appealing is writing blogs and maintain my personal website. As I progress in this beautiful world I found multiple friends and other people who have the same taste as me and it’s really feels like 20s :&gt; but one thing that always was my question is that how can i make a very reliable structure to format for my personal website, blog, the favorite things that I like and in the same time make them visually look good. I got the idea to make a static site generation tool but as you may know there is multiple great options available, but as you know may not know I’m a very From Scratch person, then I made my own tool called Staticy that was not a fully static site generation tool (it supposed to be that but I didn’t continue it) but it was a blogging tool, it can turn your markdown files into static html files the dynamic template stuff. I have multiple idea for it but after all that idea was not unique and finally it’s just my own toy project that I use to generate my blogs (yes even this blog xd). Anyway, I said those things to get to the point that I realized a personal website can be literally anything, and because 90% of the times I do nothing but writing, it’s a great fit for me. And one more thing that was really appealing for me was the fact that people don’t read/write anymore, and this website can be a great point to inspire other people to write/read. Well this time again I said I want to make my own program/website. my idea was a website that uses modern technologies (reacting client only pages) that can turn my markdown files into html but with a better structure + an environment for me to experience custom script that make cool things while the UI is still retro and simple/minimal for the old web. in a nut-shell a minimal personal website using modern programming stack that uses the same design of my current website (this web space). Well that was great bmecause i wanted to learn a new UI framework while I was working on that project, my goal is a framework called ‘Svelte’ that sounds very cool to me.\nBut later that time I said, what if i turn my obsidian vault into a website, you may ask why? because 90% of the things that i post in my website is just pure text. I’m a writer and i didn’t know about it lol. Well that was a thing, because at first, AGAIN i ranted to make my own tool but after a quick search I got a tool that already made for this job. A tool called Quartz. It’s interesting but a bit complicated for just a tool that converts obsidian vault into html files (it’s an static site generation with the focus of obsidian environment structure). why it’s a bit complicated? because it has its own internal Component system :&gt;.\nWell anyway, I installed it and using it was a charm, It’s easy to build/update your obsidian notes with quartz, plus it has a dynamic system that you can literally change a lot of things if you don’t like it (it’s like a double edge sword, it’s dynamic but not minimal).\nWell here we are. I still want to re-make my website with Svelte but probably i’ll write my primary development contents inside my Fractuna web space.\nOh btw, My goal is to make a community inside the Youtube and post technical/programming contents inside it, that way of communication is the only way that I can express myself. For sure I’ll write another blog post for that topic and introduce you to the concept of communication through writing.\nUntil that time, have a great nerding time!"},"04---Diary/2026-02-09":{"slug":"04---Diary/2026-02-09","filePath":"04 - Diary/2026-02-09.md","title":"2026-02-09","links":[],"tags":["godot-doc","game-development","godot-3D"],"content":"well I think I should spend more time working with 3D part of Godot game engine.

Transform\n۱۲. هر شئ در صحنه دارای یک نقطه مرکزی و مقادیر مختصات محلی خودش است، که با حرکت شئ تغییر میکند، اما صحنه نیز دارای یک مرکز اصلی و مختصات است که به هیچ وجه حرکت نمیکند.\n۱۳. کلاس Input مجموعه ای از متد هایی را برای دریافت وروردی از کاربر مانند موس یا کیبورد را دارد که وارد شدن و یا نشدن انهارا برمیگرداند.\n۱۴. این تایع با دریافت نوع ورودی ۱ و یا -۱ را در صورت فشردن و یا نفشردن ورودی برمیگرداند.\n۱۵. Rotate، مختصات اصلی را جایگزین میکنیم، چرا؟ چون میخواهیم ان را در یک بازه محدود کنیم.\n۱۶. تایع Math.Clamp برای محدود کردن یک عدد بین یک بازه مورد استفاده قرار میگیرد:\nvar vertical = Math.Clamp(GetAxis(&quot;Mouse X&quot;) * speed, MinVersis, MaxVersis)\n۱۷. Translate\n۱۸. به دلیل اینکه بازی در frame rate های مختلف میتواند رفتار های مختلفی داشته باشد، ما میبایست سرعت اجرای اجزای خودمان را از frame rate اصلی جدا کنیم و با سرعت یکسان ان را اجرا نکنیم. این امر را میتوانیم با ضرب کردن مقادیرمان در Time.DeltaTime بدست اوریم که اختلاف عدد بین frame rate ها است. از این روش چه بازی بر روی ۳۰ فریم اجرا شده و چه ۶۰ فریم، سرعت اجرا بازی بر اساس اختلاف frame rate محاسبه میشود و بازی به صورت خوبی اجرا خواهد شد.\n۱۹. از تابع Math.ClampMagnitude استفاده میکنیم که بازه حرکتی مارا بر اساس Speed محدود میکند.\n۲۰. از تابع TransformDirection استفاده میکنیم.\n۲۱. جاذبه را میتوان با عددی ثابت ایجاد و برابر با حرکت عمودی بازیکن قرار دهیم.\n۲۲. سیستم raycast یک پرتو خط نامرعی را از نقطه ای ایجاد کرده و به امتداد یک جهت میتاباند، در این مسیر این پرتو به هر شئ که برخورد کند محل برخورد و شئ برخورد شده را برمیگرداند.\n۲۳. استفاده های بسیاری را میتوان از این موضوع داشت، یکی از انها ایجاد یک سیستم shooting است.\n۲۴. یک پرتو را از یک مختصات به عنوان مختصات شروع گرفته و یک ابجکت برای ذخیره اطلاعات برخورد در اینده را دریافت میکند و ان پرتو را در جهت اعلام شده میتاباند و در صورت برخورد به شئ، محل برخورد و شئ را در متغیر داده شده در اول کار بر میگرداند.\n۲۵. coroutine ها برای اجرای فانکشن هایی در بازی هستند که ما یا نمیخواهیم انهارا همان لحظه اجرا گنیم و یا میخواهیم کاری را در اینده برای ما انجام دهند، یک کوروتین میتواند عملیاتی را در چندین فریم پخش کرده، برای مثال در یک فریم متوقف شود و در فریم های اینده دوباره شروع به کار کند.\nدر حالت معمول، تمامی فانکشن هایی که صدا میزنیم یک دستور را دریافت کرده و تا اتمام ان کنترل اجرایی را در دست خود دارند، اما کوروتین ها میتوانند بخشی از کاری را انجام داده، کنترل را به دست بازی برگردانند و در زمانی دیگر دوباره کنترل را به دست گیرند و کار را به اتمام برسانند. به همین موضوع کوروتین ها در اصل async نیستند ولی به Unity با استفاده از Ienumerate ها انها را شبیه سازی غیر همزمان میکند (با متوقف سازی جریان یک کوروتین و دوباره اجرا کردن ان از موقیت قبلی) به همین دلیل کوروتین ها در یک thread اصلی بازی اجرا شده و thread جدیدی ساخته نمیشود.\n۲۶. این تابع بعد از render شدن اجزای صفحه اجرا میشود، به همین دلیل است که محتویاط این تابع همیشه بر روی بقیه اجزای رندر شده قرار میگیرد.\n۲۷. عملیات رندر به ترسیم اجزای ۳ بعدی بر روی یک شبکه ۲ بعدی گفته میشود، یک شبکه ۳ بعدی در نهایت به پیکس های ۲ بعدی تبدیل شده و محاسبه رنگ انها برای ترسیم را رندر میگوییند.\n۲۸. به دلیل اینکه SpherCast میتواند دارای یک شعاع خاص و مشخص شده باشد که با استفاده از ان فاصله بازیکن با اجزای برخورد شده را محاسبه کرد.\n۲۹. prefab ها در اصل یک کپی از شئ هستند که در محیط دارای ما وجود دارند با این تغییر که تمامی مولفه ها و ویژگی هارا نیز در خود ذخیره میکنند (برای مثال مولفه اسکریپت های داده شده به یک شئ در ان ذخیره شده) و در صورت قرار گیری در صحنه تمامی انها با شئ اصلی به صحنه اضافه میشوند. از این رو برای اینکه هربار نخواهیم تمامی ویژگی هارا به یک شئ اضافه کنیم از prefab ها استفاده میکنیم.\n۳۰. خارج\n۳۱. instance\n۳۲. زیرا با serialize کردن یک صفت میتوانیم همچنان انرا خصوصی نگه داریم ولی با پابلیک کردن ان دیگر نمیشود ان صفت را خصوصی نگه داشت و میتوان به ان در کلاس های دیگر نیز دسترسی پیدا کرد.\n۳۳. با استفاده از Material. با استفاده از این ویژگی تمامی خواص های سطحی یک شئ مانند رنگ و یا زخامت و یا براق بودن ان را میتوان مدیریت کرد.\n۳۴. این تابع با روشن بودن مقدار isTrigger میتواند در صورت برخورد با یک شئ صدا زده شود (Unity این تابع را به صورت اتوماتیک در صورت برخورد صدا میزند) و ورودی این تابع که میشود parameter ما، شئ برخورد شده است.\n۳۵. برای شبیه بازی بهتر فیزیکی از مولفه RigidBody استفاده میکنیم.\n۳۶. asset ها به نوعی دارایی های بصری یک پروژه بازی هستند که میتوانند شامل دارای های هنری باشند که معمولا به صورت یک فایل مورد استفاده یک موتور بازی سازی قرار گرفته میشوند.\n۳۷. دارای های یک بازی\n۳۸. توضیحات کامل به ترتیب:\nتصاویر های ۲ بعدی: تصاویر تخت معمولا مانند عکس و یا نقاشی هستند\nتصاویر های ۳ بعدی: مدل های ۳ بعدی در اصل از همان مش های توضیح داده شده تشکلی میشوند و به نوعی مترادف مش هستند اما به صورت دقیق کلمه مش برای اشاره کردن به خطوط به هم وصل شده مش گفته میشود و مدل برای دیگر ویژگی های تصاویر ۳ بعدی به کار میرود.\nانیمیشن ها: انیمیشن با حرکات یک شئ در زمان های پیاپی (فریم ها) اشاره دارد که محل حرکات از قبل تایین شده است، این در مقابل محاسبه در زمان اسکریپت ها برای حرکت یک شئ است.\nمتریال ها: بسته ای برای نمایش ویژگی های سطحی یک شئ متصل شده است.\nسیستم ذرات: این سیستم مکانیزمی برای مدیریت حرکت دسته ای یا چندین شئ کوچک است مانند ذرات اب\n۳۹. این اولین مرحله بعد از طراحی یک بازی بر روی کاغذ است، که ما دیواره هایی را با رنگ سفید ترسیم کرده و شکل کلی مپ بازی را میسازیم. این موضوع ۲ دلیل دارد:\n۱. این کار برای کار های تیمی بسیار خوب است، زیرا طراحان و برنامه نویسان هر دو میتوانند با استفاده از این روش، ویژگی های خود را به بازی اضافه کنند بدون اینکه نیازی به صبر کردن و اتمام کار یک تیم باشد.\n۲. این نسخه شاید کامل نباشد ولی میتوان از همین نسخه برای ایجاد گیم پلی و برنامه نویسی یک پروژه بازی استفاده کرد، هرچقدر کم ولی کاربردی مانند راه رفتن ساده. برای مثال میتوان چک کرد ایا ارتفاع سقف در این اتاق برای این بازی کن کافی است یا نه.\n۴۰. در واقع texture به معنای یک تصویر ۲ بعدی است که بر روی یک سطح ۳ بعدی قرار میگیرد و میتواند از نظر ظاهری انرا تغییر دهد.\n۴۱. تصویر کاشی پذیر تصویری است که انتهای ان امکان امتداد خود را دارند\n۴۲. نوع فشرده سازی و کانال الفا\n۴۳. به صورت فنی بافت ها به صورت مستقیم بر روی یک شکل هندسی (مش ها) قرار نمیگیرند و در اصل بخشی از مواد (متریال) هستند، به همین دلیل وقتی یک texture را به یک شئ ۳ بعدی اضافه میکنیم در اصل یک مواد برای ان ایجاد میکند. پس در نتیجه میتوان یک تکستچر را با چندین متریال استفاده کرد.\n۴۴. اسکای باکس یک جعبه بزرگ است که دوربین را با تصاویری از اسمان از هر طرف میپوشاند، در نتیجه مهم نیست از کدام بخش به ان نگاه کنیم.\n۴۵. Shader ها به دستور العمل هایی برای ترسیم یک سطح بر روی جسم گفته میشود. کامپیوتر در نهایت با اجرای این دستور العمل ها رندر یک سطح را انجام میدهد. برای مثال یکی از مهم ترین انها استفاده از سایه زن تیره کننده پیکس های تصویر است در اصل تابعی از نور خورشید بر روی سطح است.\n۴۶. اینکه ایا مدل انیمیشن دارد یا خیر مهم است که فرمت FBX از انیمیشن استفاده میکند، ولی اگر نتوانستیم خروجی ان فرمت را بگیریم، دیگر فرمتی به نام COLLADA نیز فرمت خوبی است که انیمیشن را هم پشتیبانی میکند.\n۴۷. به واسط بصری بازی های کامپیوتری مانند دگمه تنظیم صدا و یا شروع بازی و به دلیل اینکه معمولا در بالای صفحه مورد استفاده قرار میگیرند به انها HUD و یا heads up display گفته میشود.\n۴۸. زیرا میتوان تمامی تغییرات را در صفحه در همان لحظه طراحی دید و کار با تصاویر در این سیستم راحت تر است.\n۴۹. Sprite\n۵۰. Canvas\n۵۱. کنوس ها یک سیستم رابطه کاربری در Unity هستند.\n۵۲. ۳ نوع مختلف رندر canvas به شرح زیر است:\n۱. render overlay: در این حالت canvas به صورت گرافیک ۲ بعدی در بالای دوربین ترسیم میشود.\n۲. render camera: در این حالت canvas به صورت گرافیک ۲ بعدی در بالای دوربین ترسیم میشود ولی میتوان برای جلوه های پرسپکتیو انرا چرخش داد.\n۳. render world space: در این حالت canvas به نوعی بخشی از صحنه ۳ بعدی بازی میشود.\n۵۳: anchor ها در اصل لنگر هایی هستند که مکان UI ها با توجه به ان تنظیم میشود. به نوعی مرکز یک المنت UI را مشخص کرده و ان المنت بر اساس این ترسیم و یا جابجا میشود. برای مثال با استفاده از این سیستم میتوان با scale کردن صفحه بازی یک المنت را در مکان مشخص خودش قرار دهیم که مکان ان عوض نشود.\n۵۴. تابع onClick در صورت فشرده و رها شدن دکمه UI بر روی صفحه به صورت اتوماتیک توسط Unity اجرا میشود."},"06---Study/Semester-02/Internet-Engineering/Exams/Network-Exam":{"slug":"06---Study/Semester-02/Internet-Engineering/Exams/Network-Exam","filePath":"06 - Study/Semester 02/Internet Engineering/Exams/Network Exam.md","title":"Network Exam","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"صفحات مهم:\n۱. 197-200 - توضیحات قسمت های یک بسته TCP\n۲. 216 - توضیحات نام های مختلف TLD (نام های حوضه)\nوظایف لایه انتفال در شبکه:\nفراهم اوردن خدمات سازماندهی شده، مطمعا و میتنی بر اصول سیستم عامل برای برنامه های کاربردی در لایه های بالاتر\nبه گونه ای که مشکلات و ناکارامدی لایه IP جبران شود.\nمشکلات (کمبود) لایه IP چیست؟\n۱. تضمینی برای اماده بودن destination برای دریافت بسته وجود ندارد\n۲. تضمینی وجود ندارد که بسته های موازی به ترتیب ارسال دریافت شوند\n۳. تضمینی برای دیر رسیدن بسته و یا بسته های شبیه هم وجود ندارد که دوباره ارسال شوند\n۴. این لایه تضمینی برای تحویل یک بسته به چندین پروسه مختلف را ندارد زیرا توانایی تفکیک بسته   هارا ندارد\n\nبه همین دلیل ما از پروتکل هایی مانند TCP و یا UDP استفاده میکنیم که این کاستی هارا پر کنند.\n\nچگونه پروتکل TCP کاستی های IP را حل میکند:\n۱. ایجاد یک ارتباط اولیه قبل از ارسال هرگونه داده به مقصد و ایجاد یک ارتباط پایانی قبل از اتمام یک ارتباط (پروتکل های اتصال گرا)\n۲/۳. برای این موضوع تی سی پی یک شمارنده را در سرایند (Header) بسته که بخشی از داده اصلی است، به همراه یک زمان سنج و یک کد ۱۶ بیتی برای رفع خطا و صحت داده های ارسال شده قرار داده و ان را به لایه IP میدهد.\nشمارنده برای ارسال به ترتیب داده ها و زمان سنج برای اینکه چه مقدار صبر کند که اگر داده ای دریافت نشد عملی دیگر انجام دهد (باز ارسال داده برای مثال). درستی ارسال بسته بافر فرستنده را reset کرده و داده جدید را میسازد، در غیر این صورت بافر استفاده شده دوباره ارسال میشود.\n۴. هر بسته تی سی پی، برای خود دارای یک شماره شناسایی در سرایند بسته است، این شماره تایین کننده ادرس port ارسال کننده و گیرنده در ارتباط است.

Many news websites, weblogs, schools and podcasters operate web feeds. As web feeds are designed to be machine-readable rather than human-readable they can also be used to automatically transfer information from one website to another without any human intervention.\nNumber of items in RSS\nAlthough the number of items in an RSS channel is theoretically unlimited, some news aggregators do not support RSS files larger than 150KB.\nHow got famous\nAlthough RSS formats have evolved from as early as March 1999,[6] it was between 2005 and 2006 when RSS gained widespread use, and the (&quot;&quot;) icon was decided upon by several major web browsers.[7] RSS feed data is presented to users using software called a news aggregator and the passing of content is called web syndication. Users subscribe to feeds either by entering a feed’s URI into the reader or by clicking on the browser’s feed icon.

With its privacy-first approach and high-speed processing, Ollama enables seamless AI interactions without cloud dependencies. Whether you’re coding, automating tasks, or engaging in deep conversations, Ollama provides a reliable and customizable AI experience.\nOptimization of models\nOne of the standout features of Ollama is its use of quantization to optimize model performance. Quantization reduces the computational load, allowing these models to run efficiently on consumer-grade laptops and desktops. This is no small feat, considering the size and complexity of modern LLMs. It also means you can use AI offline, keeping your data on your device for enhanced security and privacy.\nCustomizing the models\nCustomization is another area where Ollama shines. It uses something called a “model file,” which is essentially a text file that defines how a model should be built, customized, and configured. In this file, you can specify a base model, set default system prompts, and even fine-tune the model using a method called LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). LoRA is a lightweight fine-tuning technique that adapts pre-trained models to specific tasks without altering the original weights. This makes it possible to specialize models for niche applications without the need for full retraining, which can be resource-intensive.\nAuthors\nIt’s a Canadian company that made this tool\nModels\nllama3.1\nIt’s a great ai LLM model made by meta\nphi3\nDeveloped by Microsoft.\nاین مدل، بهترین عملکرد را در یک معیار خاص و در یک زمان معین دارد.\nTrained data\nOur training data includes a wide variety of sources, totaling 3.3 trillion tokens, and is a combination of 1) publicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data, and code; 2) newly created synthetic, “textbook-like” data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.); 3) high quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness."},"06---Study/Semester-02/Internet-Engineering/Exercises/توضیحات-تکمیلی-پروژه-تحلیل-اخرین-خبر-ها-با-هوش-مصنوعی---درس-مهندسی-اینترنت":{"slug":"06---Study/Semester-02/Internet-Engineering/Exercises/توضیحات-تکمیلی-پروژه-تحلیل-اخرین-خبر-ها-با-هوش-مصنوعی---درس-مهندسی-اینترنت","filePath":"06 - Study/Semester 02/Internet Engineering/Exercises/توضیحات تکمیلی پروژه تحلیل اخرین خبر ها با هوش مصنوعی - درس مهندسی اینترنت.md","title":"توضیحات تکمیلی پروژه تحلیل اخرین خبر ها با هوش مصنوعی - درس مهندسی اینترنت","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"با سلام  و خسته نباشید. این PDF تمامی موارد تئوری پروژه تحلیل اخرین خبر ها با هوش مصنوعی را در بر دارد. که شامل موارد زیر میباشد:\n\nدرباره پروژه\nانگیزه ساخت پروژه\nساختار پروژه\nجامع مخاطب\n\n۱. درباره پروژه\nدر دنیای امروزی نیاز استفاده از هوش مصنوعی در بسیاری موارد مختلف احساس میشود، تحلیل داده هایی که مرتبا در حال تغییر هستند یکی از موارد بسیار مهم این موضوع است. این پروژه به یکی از این نوع داده ها میپردازد: اخبار. خبر ها با حجم های مختلف و معمولا بسیار زیاد در بستر اینترنت توضیح میشوند و روزانه میلیون ها مخاطب را در بر خود دارند. اما این سوال مطرح میشود که ایا استفاده از هوش مصنوعی میتواند به این امر سرعت و کیفیت بیشتری ببخشد؟ اینجاست که میتوان موضوع این پروژه را مطرح نمود.  این پروژه با استفاده از مدل های هوش مصنوعی میتواند اخرین خبر های دریافت شده از منبع های مختلف ها دریافت و با پردازش و تحلیل ان مدل، یک واحد خلاصه و مفید را برگرداند.\nیکی از ویژگی های مدل های هوش مصنوعی، نزدیک بودن ان به نوع پردازش فکری انسان است، همین موضوع باعث ایجاد بستری بسیار عالی برای خبر ها میشود، زیرا مدل های هوش مصنوعی میتوانند با °طبقه بندی کردن اخبار با استفاده از الگریتم های خود یک واحد خبری بسیار قابل درک برای کاربران را ایجاد کنند.\n۲. انگیزه ساخت پروژه\nاین پروژه ترکیبی از یک سیستم خبر خوان (News Alligator) و هوش مصنوعی (میتوان هر مدل هوش مصنوعی باشد) بر پایه web API است که میتواند سطحی جدید به ساختار و بستر برنامه های حال حاظر اضافه کند. این سرویس میتواند در هر کجا اجرا شده و با ایجاد یک کلاینت (Client) برای دستگاه های استفاده کننده هرکجا از این سرویس استفاده کرد. این پروژه را میتوان با وبسایت ها و سایر سرویس های دیگر ترکیب و یک سیستم Hybrid را در بر داشت (از انجا که این برنامه صرفا یک برنامه GUI نیست و یک سرویس به حساب میاید).\nاستفاده از تکنولوژی های جدید و پیشرفته تر که در ادامه با انها اشنها میشویم.\n۳. ساختار پروژه\nاین پروژه را میتوان به ۳ بخش تقسیم بندی کرد:\n\nبخش دریافت اخبار از سرویس های RSS Feed\nبخش تحلیل اخبار و واکشی محتوای مورد نیاز\nبخش پردازش اخبار توسط مدل های هوش مصنوعی\nبخش cache کردن اخبار ها\n\nدریافت اخبار از سرویس های RSS Feed\nاین موضوع اولین و یکی از مهم ترین بخش های این سرویس به حساب میاید. طبق معمول اولین کاری که در این سرویس نوشته شده است دریافت اخبار از منبع های معتبر و استاندارد با استفاده از فرمت داده ای Web Feed است. این فرمت که تاریخچه طولانی دارد در سال ۱۹۹۹ (که میشود ۲۶ سال پیش) اولین ورژن خود را (۰.۹۰) به جامعه اینترنت معرفی کرد. RSS یکی از فرمت های برگفته از فرمت web feed است، حال سوال اینجاست که چرا ما از یک فرمت به خصوص برای این موضوع استفاده میکنیم و مثلا محتوای وبسایت هارا یکی یکی نمیخوانیم. RSS ها دارای یک فرمت استاندارد و به خصوص برای توضیح خبر در سرتاسر اینترنت است، با استفاده از انها دیگر نیازی تمامی وبسایت هارا برای دریافت محتوای مورد نیزا کاوش کرد زیرا این فرمت در خورد Metadata های بسیار مهمی دارد که تمامی موارد مورد نیزا برای یک سرویس خبر خوان را شامل میشود. هر فایل RSS که معمولا به صورت XML یا در برخی موارد JSON است دارای فیلد های مختلفی مانند Link و یا Publish Date است که با استفاده از انها میتوان به سادگی محتوا را مورد استفاده قرار دارد.\nپس در اولین مورد سرویس، یک فایل RSS را از وبسایت سرویس خبری دریافت و با ارسال درخواست HTTPS به ان، محتوای ان را دریافت میکند، قابل توجه است که تعداد اخبار ها،  بستگی به سایت مراجعه گننده دارد که ما استفاده از نیاز های سرویس خودمان میتوان ان هارا مدیریت کنیم. پس داده خبر ها دریافت شده و حال نیاز به برنامه ای داریم که بتوانیم با استفاده از ان این فرمت را خوانده و تبدیل به ساختار داده زبان برنامه نویسی مورد استفاد کنیم. این موضوع با استفاده از کتابخانه های نوشته شده برای ان زبان برنامه نویسی میتواند صورت بگیرد. با توجه به این موضوع که این پروژه از زبان برنامه نویسی Golang استفاده میکند، پس از کتابخانه go-feed برای این موضوع استفاده شده است. این کتابخانه با تبدیل ساختار RSS به ساختار داده زبان برنامه نویسی Go کار را برای ما اسان تر میکند.\nبعد از بدست اوردن ان ساختار، میتوان فیلد ها و بخش های مختلف RSS دریافت شده را مورد استفاده قرار دهیم. بخش های مورد نیاز موارد زیر است:\n\nعنوان خبر\nتاریخ خبر\nوبسایت لینک شده دارای محتوای خبر\n\nهمانجور که گفته شده، ما با استفاده از نیازمان تعداد خبر های مورد نظر را از منبع اصلی دریافت میکنیم، این پروژه بر اساس n تا از اخرین خبر ها طراحی شده است که میتوانیم برای مثال ۵ تا از اخرین خبر هارا داشته باشیم. این کار را میتوانیم با استفاده از تاریخ انتشار خبر انجام داده و ۵ تا از اخرین خبر هارا دریافت کنیم.\nبعد از دریافت کردن ۵ تا از اخرین خبر ها، ما نیاز به دریافت محتوای خبر را داریم. از انجا که محتوای اخبار بسیار زیاد است پس یک فایل RSS لینک دسترسی به ان خبر را به جای خبر اصلی در اختیار ما قرار میدهد.\nبرای بدست اوردن محتوای ان ۵ خبر ما نیاز به ارسال درخاست های HTTPS  به هرکدام از این ۵ تا صفحه خبر داریم. این کار را میتوانیم با استفاده از کتابخانه های تعبیه شده در زبان برنامه نویسی Go انجام بدهیم، اما برای اینکه سرعت و کیفیت سرویس بالا تر باشد، این سرویس از قابلیت اجرای همزمانی Goroutine استفاده میکنیم. اجرای همزمانی به ما اجازه ارسال و دریافت محتوای های هرکدام از این n صفحه خبری را به صورت همزمان میدهد، که مراحل این کار به شرح زیر است:\nبرای هر خبر یک Goroutine اجرا شده و درخواست را به همان صفحه ارسال کرده، محتوا را دریافت و بقیه مراحل را پیش میگیرد.\n(قابل توجه است که تمامی موارد مدیریتی ارسال درخواست از جمله مدیریت timeout ها، داده ها، و غیر انجام شده است)\nتحلیل اخبار و واکشی موارد مورد نیاز\nمرحله بعدی خواندن محتوا های دریافت شده است، این موضوع به سادگی دریافت Body صفحه HTML مورد نظر نیست، زیرا ان صفحه ها محتوای های اضافی مانند تگ های HTML و حتی ممکن است دارای کد های Javascript را در خود دارند، به همین دلیل ما نیاز به استفاده از ابزاری دیگر برای بدست اوردن محتوای اصلی یک صفحه را داریم. ممکن از شما در استفاده از Browser خورد گزینه ای مانند Read را دیده باشید، این گزینه تمامی موارد اضافی صفحات را  کنار شده و محتوای اصلی را نمایش میدهد، که این کار با الگریتم های پیشرفته و موتور های خواندن متن صورت میگیرد که ما در این سرویس این کار را با کتابخانه go-readability انجام میدهیم. (این کتابخانه در اصل یک implementation فرعی موتور خوانای firefox browser است) این کتابخانه به صورت خلاصه دارای یک سیستم پیشفرض از تگ های مهم در ارتباط با محتوای اصلی وبسایت است (ماند تگ Article در HTML) که هرکجا ان تگ های مورد نظر را ببیند انها را عدد بندی میکند، و در نتیجه بهترین انها انتخاب شده و به صورت یک متن string برمیگردد. به دلیل طولانی شدن این PDF پیشنهاد میشود رفرنس زیر را مطالعه بفرمایید:\n\ndejan.ai/blog/deconstructing-domdistiller-how-chromes-reader-mode-algorithm-impacts-technical-seo/\n\nبعد از دریافت تمامی صفحات و خواندن انها توسط موتور های مورد نظر، green-thread های ایجاد شده توسط برنامه بسته شده و برنامه از نو به روال اجرای خطی خود باز میگردد.\nپس تا به اینجای کار ما دارای یک ساختار از ۵ تا از اخرین خبر های پردازش شده و خوانده شده با محتوای مفید هستیم، مرحله اخر تحویل این محتواها به مدل های هوش مصنوعی برای تحلیل انها است.\nپردازش اخبار توسط مدل های هوش مصنوعی\nدر این مرحله برای تحلیل بهتر داده ها توسط مدل های هوش مصنوعی ان ۵ تا خبر را به یک فرمت json تبدیل کرده (زیرا مدل های هوش مصنوعی مخصوص این کار ها، ساختار های استاندارد مانند json را بهتر و بیشتر از plain text ها درک میکنند) و ان را به یک مدل هوش مصنوعی تحویل دهیم.\nاز انجا که پروژه به صورت داینامیک و با استفاده از interface های مختلف برای هر بخش ایجاد شده است، میتوان به راحتی هر بخش را به صورت جدا نوشت و تعویض کرد، برای مثال پروژه اصلی از مدل های هوش مصنوعی Local (یعنی اجرا بر روی سیستم خودمان) استفاده میکند، ولی میتوانیم ان را با یک مدل Cloud base مانند ChatGPT تعویض شده و بخش های دیگر پروژه نیازی به تغییر ندارد.\nبرنامه Ollama که یک برنامه برای در دسترس قرار دادن های LLM ها برای اجرای بر روی سیستم کاربران با استفاده از تکنیک های Optimization برای اجرای سریع و کامل تعبیه شده است، دارای مدل های مختلفی همچنان llama3.1 از شرکت Meta و  phi3 از شرکت Microsoft است. این مدل ها بسته به قدرت سخت افزار میتواند بر روی سیستم اجرا شده و با استفاده از یک web api میتواند برای کاربران سرویس اراعه دهند.\nمزایای استفاده از ollama اجرای مدل هوش مصنوعی به صورت local است که نیاز ما از استفاده از سرویس های centralize و cloud را کاهش داده و پیشنیاز های سرویس را در بستر خودمان مدیریت میکند.\nاز هر ۲ مدل در این پروژه استفاده شده که مدل Phi3 برای سیستم عای عامه بیشتر ترجیح داده میشود.\nپس یک مدل هوش مصنوعی با دریافت خبر ها به صوررت json انها را خوانده و تحلیل خود را بر میگرداند. این داده های خبری در کنار یک پرامت (prompt) مخصوص ارسال شده تا تمامی ساختار خروجی مدیریت شده و راهی مشخص به مدل هوش مصنوعی داده شود، این کار را میتوانیم با کمک مهندسان پرامت نویسی انجام دهیم که این پروژه یک پرامت ساده و خوب برای نمایش اطلاعات را در خود دارد. نکته مهم دیگر این است که داده دریافت شده به صورت یک stream است که هر کلمه generate شده توسط مدل های هوش مصنوعی به کاربر برگردانده میشود.\nتمامی ویژگی های گفته شده به صورت یک web API به کاربران اراعه داده شده که میتوان با استفاده از یک کلاینت مانند Browser کامپیوتر از این سرویس استفاده کرد.\nبخش Cache کردن اخبار ها\nتمامی سیستم های مورد استفاده امروزی با استفاده از cache کردن داده ها، سرعت دسترسی به داده ها را کاهش میدند، این سرویس نیز از این موضوع مستثنا نیست. پس به جای هربار اجرای تمامی موارد بالا میتوان یک بار موارد بالا را اجرا گرفت و بعد از ان انها را در یک سیستم cache، برای مثال پایگاه های داده و یا Redis ذخیره کرد.\nسرویس میتواند هر ۳۰ دقیقه برای مثال خبر های جدید را دریافت و پردازش کرده و در cache خود ذخیره کند و سرعت دسترسی کاربر را بسیار افزایش دهد. این کار را در حال حاظر با ارسال درخواست به بخش cache/ این سرویس مورد استفاده قرار داد.\nجامع مخاطب\nاین ابزار برای مدیران وبسایت و یا حتی به صورت stand alone یعنی یک سرویس کاملا جدا اجرا شده میتواند باشد که کاربران از انها استفاده کنند. هرکسی میتواند این سرویس را اجرا کرده و با فراهم کردن کلاینت ها مختلف (که به صورت اماده هم میتوان استفاده کرد) به کاربران خود سرویس ارائه دهد.\nپس برنامه نویسان و طراحان وبسایت سرویس را اجرا و در نهایت کاربران معمولی با استفاده از نرم افزار های مربوطه (مانند browser) میتوانند از این سرویس استفاده کنند.\nدیگر جامع مخاطبان میتوان تحلیل گران خبر باشد که نیاز به دریافت مطالب مهم و حیاتی یک خبر را دارند که باز هم در نقش یک کاربر میتوانند از این سرویس استفاده کنند (چه به صورت استفاده کننده و چه به صورت اجرا کننده)\nبا تشکر از شما و وقتی که برای توضیحات گذاشتید."},"06---Study/Semester-02/Operating-System-Workshop/Concepts/Class-4":{"slug":"06---Study/Semester-02/Operating-System-Workshop/Concepts/Class-4","filePath":"06 - Study/Semester 02/Operating System Workshop/Concepts/Class 4.md","title":"Class 4","links":[],"tags":["Ubuntu","daily","shell","kernel","share-folder","unix"],"content":"Class Concepts\n\nSearch panel\nnetwork settings (DHCP or manually DHCP)\nIf we use bridge network (in vmware settings) we can set an ip address from our own network (not a new virtual network)\nDisplay settings\nPower settings\nSearch settings\ninstalling program with apt and app discovery.

Therefore the max thread count is 96 and max core count is 48.\nWhat is better ?\nThat depends on what you want to do, more threads means less frequency (ie a 3ghz becomes split in two) but better multi-tasking (more threads) and using full cores (no hyper-threading) is better for high CPU usage tasks (ie games).\nHope this helps you.\n2. Does threads share the same memory?\nThreads share the same memory space. Each process has its own set of system resources. Threads share resources within the same process. Processes are more independent of each other.\nExam (در امتحان میاد)\nتفاوت process و thread (نخ)\nRefs:\n\nPreemptive and cooperative multi tasking\nHyperThreading\nThread Word File\nA Good video about threading in python youtube (Threading in Python)\nChatGPT chats about threading - chatGPT\n\n\nExercise Concepts\nWhat is thread actually\nThreads are the concepts that we use in computer science to give tasks to units of CPU that are IDLE and don’t have something to work on. That means if a part of the CPU is waiting for the result of another part of it, we can give that idle part a job of other tasks to perform, this way we can fill the gap of being idle by waiting for something else.\nAs cores are actual physical things, threads are just software. With that said, when we say this CPU supports N threads, it doesn’t mean CPU itself has real threads, but that the CPU supports simultaneous multi threading (hyper threading) meaning that when a core is in the middle of processing an instruction that results in having to wait for a slower operation to complete, that core can begin executing some instructions from another thread for a while.\nThen:\nHyper-threading is a technology that allows each core in a CPU to work on multiple tasks at once by simulating additional virtual cores. This can improve performance in certain applications that benefit from parallel processing.\nThen:\nOn the software side we have another similar concept also called ‘threads’, which is just multiple separate processes operating under a single process. The main process manages data between the threads. Each thread can only be run under a single core or single logical core, so a process creating many software threads is a way it can operate on multiple logical cores simultaneously.\nThreading in Python\n\nEach process have 1 main thread, and you can call more other threads with that main thread.\n\nwe can use .start() to start a thread, and .join() to wait until the thread finish its job\nFor sharing data between threads we can use global scope variables, but we should be careful because if multiple thread access 1 shared object then we’ll have ‘Race Condition’. Then we need to ‘lock’ the state of the global shared variable for each thread callback.\nWe can do it with threading.Lock() and aquire() and release() functions.\nwe can make a queue of job with a simple array and lock to prevent all those things that said above\nwe can return values by using the extend Threading class or same global variables.\nAnother way to communicate with the threads is to use Events. Event class is a simple class where we can set a value (boolean) for an event and then we can access it on our thread to check the event and do functionalities based on that.\n\nProvider/Consumer architecture model\nfor doing this, we need to make 2 threads and 1 queue that shares between threads\nafter that, we can put data by provider and get data by consumer and stop them when provider put a None value in queue. the queue needs to be compatible with threads\n\nHow does threading and multi processing work\nThreads and Multi-Threading\nwe have 2 different kind of threads:\n\nUser threads: support on top of kernel, and manages without kernel support\nKernel threads: Supported and managed directly by the operating system\n\nAnd for connecting those threads there are different ways, at usual we have 3 ways to relate user threads with kernel threads:\n\nMany-to-one: Many user thread to 1 kernel thread\none-to-one: One user thread to one kernel thread\nOne user thread map to 1 kernel thread\nMany-to-many: Many user thread to many kernel threads\n\nIt’s very important that kernel threads are not actually easy to make and that’s why we have some runtime solutions like user space threads (Gorouting) that map to each OS (kernel) thread and do concurrency.\nHyper-threading and Process Cores\nUsually we have 1 CPU and some cores, for example if your CPU has 4 cores then you have a quad core CPU, this means you have 4 Physical Core that your hardware handle them.\nAnd for sure, you can run multi-threaded programs on each core, and have multi processing system.\nBut what about Hyper-Threading ? Hyper-Threading means we have 2 more logical/virtual cores per 1 physical/actual core. That means if we have 4 physical cores, we actually have 8 logical cores from hyper-threading. With this way, we can do more jobs (partial 2x) but not actual real parallelism.\nWhy not real parallelism? because are using only Logical Cores and not physical cores and Logical cores shares the hardware of physical cores, For example:\nPhysical Core ‘A’:\nLogical Core ‘AL0’\nLogical Core ‘AL1’\nLogical Core ‘AL0’ and ‘AL1’ shares the hardware components of Physical core ‘A’. This means we don’t have actual parallelism, but it can runs faster and smoother.\nAnd now we can run multi-threaded programs on each logical/virtual cores and get partial parallelism. but for real parallelism, we need to actually use physical cores.\nNow you may say, Ok, then how to use physical cores? The answer is you cannot. but you can trick the OS to do that. We can’t directly talk to physical cores because hardware doesn’t have any API for that, that means operating system doesn’t know how much physical cores do we have, it just knows about logical cores and act like we have that much of real cores. if you have 6 physical cores, and hyper-threading enabled, then OS will work on 12 cores (logical cores) cause OS can only talk to logical cores at hardware level. with that said, if we want to have the real parallelism, we need to tell the operating system to put each thread on different logical core, and because we only have 2 logical cores, this will trigger the hardware to change the physical cores for us.

For example If we want to get the name of the user, we can set the Intent of our request, then we can functions differently than for example modify it.\nHttp methods are:\n\nGET: we use it to get some resources from the server\nPOST: We use it to put some resources to the server, it has the body to set data from the client\nPUT: Update some resources from the server but it should replace whatever we provide as body to the target resource (Complete Replacement)\nPATCH: Update some resources from the server but it should only patch (modify) the part of the resource that we provided as body (Modify only needed parts)\nDELETE: We use to delete a resource from the server.\nOPTIONS (CORS): it used to fetch the capability of the server for Cross Origin Requests (CORS), it controls how browser should communicate the the server resources from different host addresses.\n\nNote that Host is used for the target api that we want to request.\nAnd we use Origin is used for our own local domain (or maybe a domain from a server).\nIdempotent or non-idempotent\nPlease See The Idempotency section.\nResponse Code\nthey will return the final state or situation of functioned request from the server as a code, this code perfectly specifies what was the exact result of the request.\nThis code is standard and works across all platform, languages, systems, etc.\nOn High level response codes composed from:\n\nInformation:  1xx\nSuccess:      2xx\nRedirection:  3xx\nClient Error: 4xx\nServer Error: 5xx\n\nfor example 200 is OK message that means request was succsessful and completed properly by the server.\nOr 201 means resource has been fulfill in the reason of Creation a resource (F.g POST Method)\nor 204 means request has been fulfill in the reason of accepting content, but there is nothing to return by the server itself (Nothing to return).\n301 means move permanently, that means the requested resource has been moved to a new URL, and request should be in that new URL.

Therefore, before attempting to use the value of a weak pointer, you should check whether it is nil."},"07---Tech/07---Concepts/How-USB-Works":{"slug":"07---Tech/07---Concepts/How-USB-Works","filePath":"07 - Tech/07 - Concepts/How USB Works.md","title":"How USB Works","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"USB is a serial port.\nOther serial ports at not hotplug or auto configable.\nAll USB variants with their speed:\n\nUSB 1.0 [lowSpeed: 1.5Mbs, maxSpeed: 12Mbs]\nUSB 2.0 [maxSpeed: 480Mbs]\nUSB 3.0 [maxSpeed: 5Gbs]\nUSB 3.1 [maxSpeed: 10Gbs]\n\nBecause USB is asynchronous, then there is not any clock line\nUSB is hard in the case of implementations than UART\nUSB has to kind of connections connectors:\n\nUSB A: for host machines like computer (up-stream)\nUSB B: for client machines like indivisual devices (down-stream)\n\nFor sending data a USB uses 2 data lines called (D+, D-), usb uses D+ for Full-speed supported computers and low D- for low-speed supported computers.\nUSB can send 4 different type of data (4 data transition types for USB):\n\nControl: exchange all the settings and configurations between USB and host\nIsochronous: For time critical devices like speakers, that has real-time communication with no error detection\nBulk: devices like printers that accept one big block of data instead of serializing the data (!= Isochronous)\nIntertupts: prepherals like mouse and keyboard that needs immidiate attentions, devices that request a service from the PC host\n\nUSB Protocol"},"07---Tech/07---Concepts/Realize":{"slug":"07---Tech/07---Concepts/Realize","filePath":"07 - Tech/07 - Concepts/Realize.md","title":"Realize","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"It’s a simple program to realize any changes in the project and reload the program for new changes\nIt needs to be configured in the case for doing that."},"07---Tech/07---Concepts/Source-Control":{"slug":"07---Tech/07---Concepts/Source-Control","filePath":"07 - Tech/07 - Concepts/Source Control.md","title":"Source Control","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Source Control\nIt means controlling some sort of source (it could be anything) set versions for it."},"07---Tech/07---Concepts/Unity-Build":{"slug":"07---Tech/07---Concepts/Unity-Build","filePath":"07 - Tech/07 - Concepts/Unity Build.md","title":"Unity Build","links":[],"tags":["programming","Clang","Compilers","Trick","UnityBuild"],"content":"What is Unity Build?\nUnity build is the processes of building a program using just 1 file (often main.c).
